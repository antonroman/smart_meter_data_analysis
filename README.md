# smart_meter_data_analysis
This repository contains all the code I developed to analyze the smart meter data with HTM and LSTM for my PhD

## Data pre-processing
Scripts used to parse the data coming from the smart meters into CSV files so that we can process them easier.
The data comes in the PRIME protocols and it includes hourly and daily reports.
